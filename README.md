This is an android widget displaying the current time in [Swatch Internet Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time) and the current date in [Desamber](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/Desamber).

If you want to use this widget, you need to build it yourself! But it's easy, just clone this repo and build it with Android Studio.
